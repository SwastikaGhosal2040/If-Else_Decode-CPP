Ques: Take a positive integer input and tell if it is divisible by 5 and 3


Explanation:
% -> gives remainder
if(num%5==0 && num%3==0)
  cout<<num<<" is divisible by 5 and 3";
else
  cout<<num<<" is not divisible by 5 and 3";

Another method:
divisible by 5 and 3 means divisible by 15
if(num%15==0)
   cout<<num<<" is divisible by 5 and 3";
else
   cout<<num<<" is not divisible by 5 and 3";
