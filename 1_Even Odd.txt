Even Odd
code:
//even odd
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int num;
	cout<<"Take a positive integer input:";
	cin>>num;
	if(num % 2 == 0)
	  cout<<num<<" is even number";
	else
	  cout<<num<<" is odd number";
}

Explanation:
% operator gives us the remainder.
if (num % 2 == 0) 
  cout<<num<<"is even number";
means:
  if after dividing the number with 2 if the remainder is 0, that implies the number is divisible by 2, means the number is even.
else
  cout<<num<<"is odd number";
if after dividing the number with 2 if the remainder is not equals to 0, that implies the number is not divisible by 2, means the number is odd.
