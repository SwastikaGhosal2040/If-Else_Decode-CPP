Ques: If cost price and selling price of an item is input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller has made profit or incurred loss. Also determine how much profit he made or loss he incurred.

Explanation:
CostPrice = CP
SellingPrice = SP
let, CP = 40
     SP = 60
     Profit(SP>CP) = SP - CP = 60 - 40 = 20
     CP = 40
     SP = 20
     Loss(CP>SP)   = CP - SP = 40 - 20 = 20
code1:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	float cp;
	cout<<"Enter cost price:";
	cin>>cp;
	
	float sp;
	cout<<"Enter selling price:";
	cin>>sp;
	
	float profit = sp -cp;
	float loss = cp -sp;
	if(sp>cp)
	  cout<<"Profit amount: "<<profit;
	else if(cp>sp) 
	  cout<<"Loss amount: "<<loss;
	else   //cp==sp
	  cout<<"No profit, no loss";
}

code2://without using else
if(sp>cp)
  cout<<"Profit";
if(cp>sp)
  cout<<"Loss";
if(cp==sp)
  cout<<"No profit, no loss";
