Explanation:
if (num % 5 == 0)
  cout<<num<<"is divisible by 5";
means:
  if after dividing the number with 5 if the remainder is 0, that implies the number is divisible by 5
(% operator gives us the remainder.)
else
  cout<<num<<"is not divisible by 5";
means:
  if after dividing the number with 5 if the remainder is not equals to 0, that implies the number is not divisible by 5
